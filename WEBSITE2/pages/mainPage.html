    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>What is FreadCoin? 
    FreadCoin is a decentralized meme token that’s working under the Binance Smart Chain,
    a new crypto currency that has utility by providing knowledge on the ecosystem of the
    crypto, giving knowledge about trading on any dex and cex platforms. 
    FreadCoin believes in the communities that it has built and with a collective 
    power of decentralization we can build a powerful team that a centralized team

            <h3>Fread Symbolized</h3>
            <p>FreadCoin Symbolises a decentralised coding system that has been used for crypto.
            FreadCoin helps communities by communities, partner by partner, and each member
            of the community by its utility. A king has born to surpass the previous kings
            of the meme tokens, maintaining its Whale by vesting the tokens, minted a 1 billion supply,
            and NFT Marketplace that soon will be listed on Opensea.</p>

            <h3>Fread Coin Growth</h3>
            <p>Will continue to grow and accomplish the missions with everyone’s help, 
                and we do believe in our community. Spread the word “FreadCoin” to your friends, 
                and social media platforms. The Core Team will answer your questions, help people 
                and help us reach the goal. If you have special skills and you think you're the one

            <h3>Fair Launch</h3>
            <p>FreadCoin will have a fair-launch on defi platform. 
                It will launch once the market sale ends. The price won’t drop so fast because we 
                will do a vesting of 5% every 1 month to maintain the whales affecting the price. 
                50% of the total supply of FreadCoin will be burned automatically when it launches 
                so we can increase and stabilize the price of FreadCoin. Reducing the quantity of 
                the supply makes a good more valuable.

    <h1>Our Core Values</h1>
    <p>What is our core values?</p>
    <div class="row2">
        <div class="freadcol2">
            <h3>Trust</h3>
            <p>Projects are risky yet some succeed with them trusting on it. 
                When a community gives us their trust, we are hearing that 
                they are safe with our project. We appreciate it because 
                it doesn’t come with a refill, when it’s gone it will never 
                get back to the same community we used to be.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="freadcol2">
            <h3>Innovation</h3>
            <p>For the project to be successful, 
                innovation is not just something about value creation, 
                but value capture. With a good mindset, 
                it will definitely work because everything has a way to do it better. 
                All we need is to empower ourselves inside and embrace an attitude of a 
                FreadCoin Community.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="freadcol2">
            <h3>Commitment</h3>
            <p>The commitment of our FreadCoin Community isn’t a joke, 
                it all started from zero until there were communities and 
                supporters that helped us grow the Fread Community. 
                If you can’t value the commitment made by the FreadCoin Community, 
                your own commitments will lose their value too.
            </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row2-1">
        <div class="freadcol2-1">
            <h3>Passion</h3>
            <p>The passion is what adds so much value to a community
                and if you think about the things that you do, there’s
                so much potential for them if you do it. Our team’s passion
                is our energy, we feel it as the power that comes when 
                we focus on what a community excites. Being confused about 
                something new is part of our life, maybe it’s time for you to learn more.

        <div class="freadcol2-1">
            <h3>Responsibility</h3>
            <p>It’s the responsibility of us to do everything with our power. 
                Even if the fud is there, this community will always be as stable as 
                a bamboo that never falls down. Being a doxxed team showing our identity, 
                by making our community don’t fail with at least the best that 
                we had because we will be always here forever and for a long time period.

            <h3>Team Work</h3>
            <p>Coming together from a start building a project with a 
                relationships inside, staying together with a 
                project is our progress and working together 
                is a success for us here on the FreadCoin Community
